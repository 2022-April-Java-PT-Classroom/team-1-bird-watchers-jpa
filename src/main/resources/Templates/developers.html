                <h4>Zach</h4>
                <p>Zachary Martin is a
                    Columbus-based full-stack
                    software developer with a
                    passion for travel, the
                    outdoors,
                    gardening, and technology. His
                    passion for technology started
                    very early, when he took an
                    interest in
                    gaming. In his early 20's, he
                    built his first gaming pc, and
                    computers for his father's law
                    practice.
                    From there, his interest in
                    hardware and software design
                    grew. Though his passion was in
                    technology,
                    it was his love for the outdoors
                    and interest in life science
                    that drove his to pursue a
                    Bachelors degree
                    in Biology at Ohio University,
                    which he completed in 2009.
                    After years of working in
                    healthcare, Zach
                    decided he wanted to turn his
                    interest in technology into a
                    career, and to leave his career
                    in healthcare
                    behind! Zach is
                    enthusiastic about growing and
                    gaining new skills as a
                    software developer and is
                    looking forward to a future in
                    the field of IT!</p>
