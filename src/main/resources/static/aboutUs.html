        <br><b>Zachary Martin</b>
        <br>
        Zachary Martin is a Columbus-based full-stack software developer with a passion for travel, the outdoors,
        gardening, and technology. His passion for technology started very early, when he took an interest in
        gaming. In his early 20's, he built his first gaming pc, and computers for his father's law practice.
        From there, his interest in hardware and software design grew. Though his passion was in technology,
        it was his love for the outdoors and interest in life science that drove his to pursue a Bachelors degree
        in Biology at Ohio University, which he completed in 2009. After years of working in healthcare, Zach
        decided he wanted to turn his interest in technology into a career, and to leave his career in healthcare
        behind! He is currently enrolled in a top-rated coding bootcamp through We Can Code It, and will have his
        certification completed in August 2022. Zach is enthusiastic about growing and gaining new skills as a
        software developer and is looking forward to a future in the field of IT!
