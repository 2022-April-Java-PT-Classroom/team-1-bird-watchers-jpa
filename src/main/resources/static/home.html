        <h2>About Bird Watching</h2>
        <p class="about__bird_watching">
            At JAC Enterprises we strive to offer unique and breathtaking experiences. Bird watching is our newest
            endeavor. Birding is a more accurate name for what we offer because you will be using more senses than just
            your sight. You will be immersed in the world of the birds, not only seeing the birds but listening to them,
            and experiencing their habitat.
            <br>
            <br>Birding was started as a conservation effort to counteract a decline in the bird population due to the
            use of  feathers in the fashion industry. Birding has developed into a tourist industry that contributes
            millions to the economy. Today birders can use technology, like cameras, telescopes, binoculars and trail
            cameras to enhance their experience.
            <br>
            <br>There are many types of birders. The casual nature lover gets excited when they see a bird and can
            identify it by name. The collector has  lifetime list and is a little more organized with their birding.
            Specialists focus on one type of bird, for example raptors or flightless birds. The photographer is
            documenting their journey with pictures. No matter what kind of birder you are we have a package that will
            leave you flying high!
